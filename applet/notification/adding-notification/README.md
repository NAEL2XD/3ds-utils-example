# Applet > Notification > Adding Notification

What it does is adds a notification to your Notification Applet, it'll be a blue led if transfered to 3DS. Note that any emulators won't see it nor will get a blue led, you'll need the real hardware.

# What does it do?

When launched, the blue blinkin LED will show up and adds a notification.
